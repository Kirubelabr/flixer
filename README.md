# Getting Started with Flixer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisite

You need to install json-server globally with below command > [Json Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

npm i -g json-server

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in the browser.

I've added a `web.config.js` file to change `port of the project so it'll be available on port 9000.` you can change the port if desired.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run start-server`

Runs the script with another terminal. This will execute `json-server --watch ` command file to expose API endpoint for provided json file.


# About the project

This project is made with `create-react-app` to showcase how much I am familiar with `React`.

I've added data fetching using API calls to get data from given json file using `json-server` package along with `axios`.

## Technologies Used

* React > v18
* Antd > for UI elements
* TailwindCSS > as CSS utility
* React router dom > for page navigation
* axios > for API call
* json-server > to create API endpoints
